This wasn't generated by an AI, but by me.

# The basic idea
Take a prompt and a Jupyter notebook with materials (e.g., minimalist code snippets as inspiration for the AI or other useful code) and let the AI assistant implement the prompt.

* Use **vscode**, **kilo** Code extension, **open router** account, **openai** account.
* Use a folder with the materials notebook (**material_test_name.ipynb**) for each test.
* All other files in this folder were **AI-generated**.

and here comes the tests:

## hf_datasets

**Prompt:**
I would like a way to display the most popular HuggingFace datasets (in a Jupyter notebook). This should be based on the number of downloads.
There should be a filter option, e.g., downloads last week, last month, etc. Think of useful filters and implement them.
I'm providing you with the button box and an initial prototype as a template. Please take a look at the notebook, research how it can be implemented, and implement it.
When selecting via the button box, additional details and a link to the HuggingFace page for the dataset should be displayed.
If anything isn't clear, please ask.
